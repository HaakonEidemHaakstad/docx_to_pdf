DOCX to PDF Converter

A lightweight, drag-and-drop desktop application built with Python to batch convert Microsoft Word documents (.docx) into PDF files.


🚀 Features


Drag & Drop Interface: Simply drag your files onto the application window.

Batch Processing: Convert multiple files at once.

Responsive UI: Uses threading to ensure the application remains responsive during the conversion process.

Smart Path Handling: correctly handles file paths containing spaces.


📋 Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following:



Python 3.x installed.

Microsoft Word installed on your computer.

Note: This script relies on the docx2pdf library, which uses Microsoft Word's COM automation (Windows) or AppleScript (macOS) to perform perfect conversions.




🛠️ Installation


Clone this repository or download the docx_to_pdf.py file.

Install the required Python libraries using pip:


'''
Collapse
Copy code
pip install tkinterdnd2 docx2pdf
Collapse
Copy code
'''

tkinterdnd2: Enables drag-and-drop functionality for Tkinter.

docx2pdf: Handles the actual document conversion.


💻 Usage


Run the script from your terminal:


>
_
Collapse
Copy code
python docx_to_pdf.py
Collapse
Copy code


A window will appear.

Select one or more .docx files from your file explorer.

Drag and drop them into the white box in the application.

The conversion will start automatically. The PDFs will be saved in the same folder as the original .docx files.


📦 Building an Executable (.exe)

If you want to share this tool with someone who doesn't have Python installed, you can compile it into a standalone executable using pyinstaller.



Install PyInstaller:


>
_
Collapse
Copy code
pip install pyinstaller
Collapse
Copy code


Run the build command:


>
_
Collapse
Copy code
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --additional-hooks-dir=. --collect-all tkinterdnd2 docx_to_pdf.py
Collapse
Copy code


--noconsole: Hides the black command prompt window.

--onefile: Bundles everything into a single .exe file.

--collect-all tkinterdnd2: Ensures the drag-and-drop binaries are included.



Your executable will be located in the dist/ folder.




⚠️ Troubleshooting

"Error: No .docx files found!"
Ensure you are dropping actual .docx files. The script filters out other file types automatically.


Conversion fails or hangs
Since this tool automates Microsoft Word, ensure that:



Microsoft Word is installed and activated.

There are no dialog boxes open in Word (e.g., "Activate Office" popups) that might block the automation.
